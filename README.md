Robot Cosmos 2

## About
This game is about building robots. Users can build a physical structure of the robot using parts such as engines, jets, and more. Then, the user can use a visual programming tool to add functions to their robots, such as keyboard controls and steering.

There is also some level generation tools for generating levels. There is a simple 3D maze algorithm for generating simple mazes with some gradient lighting to add an interesting design. Also I have been experimenting with portal-like effects from transitioning from one scene to another.

Currently, the game is very sandboxy with an end objective of building robots with different designs and features. However, in the future I hope to develop more of a simple open-world enviornment similar to Minecraft.
